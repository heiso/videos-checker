# Videos Checker CLI - Plan

A simple CLI tool to scan a directory for video files, check them using ffprobe/ffmpeg, display progress, and report errors at the end.
Real-time progress
show what is happening
Show files with errors
option to choose between quick test (ffprobe ?) or long test (ffmpeg ?)
option to output report.json with {path, duration, errors, cmd: cmd that checked the file}
must be quick
